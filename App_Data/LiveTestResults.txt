During the reading for the final project proposal the app was live tested.
Observations and ammendments are recorded here.

1. Extra successful message after new and edited resource saved
1.1. Changed to debug.writeline "updated database successfully" from messagebox. 
	Still two messages to confirm save/edit successful and database updated. 
	29/07/2022

2. No total for characters used in resource main point and notes

	29/07/2022

3. Can select id first columns. Make readonly in models.
3.1. Changed in each model.
	29/07/2022

4. Missing xml data (comments) in all model classes.

	30/07/2022

5. Main and notes char used show message wrong way round. Resources.
5.1. Swapped round messages. Added xml comments as was also missing.
	29/07/2022
6. Pasted image to notes/mainpoint which correctly produced error when 
	trying to save but even when image deleted it still appears when
	trying to save. "Error input not properly formatted."
	I think it happens on new created, saved, and then re-edit as no
	id num is present. Cancel, close, and reopen seems to work. Not 
	restricted to image but happens on text so format is not issue.
	Maybe on new created must re-display with idnum from database.
6.1. Added 'assignResDataSet.Tables[1].Clear()' in repository 
	updateDBFromDataTable method between adapter.update and fill.
	line 124 resource repositiry class.
	01/08/2022

7. Expanding and minimising mucks up page format as not all coponents
	docked properly.
7.1. Played with docking in all views. Works for expand but cannot 
	work correctly with manual minimise as too much on screen. 
	It has been designed at minimal screen size.
	30/07/2022

8. Datagridview titles need rearranging in models in order of relevence
	on initial, limited first viewing.
8.1. Requires all db tables, get methods and update methods etc to change.
	Changed category to index1 and dio index6 in db, model, and repos.
	05/08/2022

9. Set column widths to view names and weblinks better 
9.1. Set to user can change column width in resource tab.
	Already set to columnheader width. Column names taken from DB.
	05/08/2022

10. Sort out virtual/foreign key in models and do not show in 
	datagridviews.
10.1. Couldn't change column visibility to false in resource.view. 
	05/08/2022 (F)
	Took out ienum and fk from models as not needed since app taking from
	db.
	05/08/2022.

11. Error message titles in models validation. 
	Received error only 100 char can be used but dont know what 
	for. Think its weblink in this case.
11.1. Added field name to error messages in models classes where 
	applicable.
	05/08/2022

12. Extend max char for weblink and set multiple lines in 
	weblink textbox. Copied big one but only half shown.
12.1. Increased weblink in model and database to 200.
	Multiple lines already set so vertical schrollbar added.
	05/08/2022

13. Change db idnum to more relavent composite keys.
13.1. 

14. Reference needs multiple lines and schroll bar
14.1. Added scroll bar vertical, already set multiple lines

15. Saving new resource when assignment not selected produces system 
	unhandled exception, continue/quit. Need to handle event properly.

	'search',and 'edit' click events prior to invoking event handler.
